    Ping statistics: Packets Sent=4, Received=4, Lost=0 (0% loss)

Observations - Task 1:
  - All pings succeeded with 0% packet loss.
  - The switch uses MAC address tables to forward frames only
    to the intended destination port (unicast forwarding).
  - In Simulation Mode, packets were NOT flooded to all ports
    after the MAC table was learned — efficient delivery observed.
  - ARP broadcast was visible on the first ping; subsequent
    pings were direct unicast.
  - Switch creates separate collision domains per port,
    resulting in fast and reliable communication.

TASK 2: BUS-LIKE TOPOLOGY (Hub-based)
--------------------------------------------------------
IP Addressing: (same as Task 1)
  PC1 - 192.168.10.1 / 255.255.255.0
  PC2 - 192.168.10.2 / 255.255.255.0

  Simultaneous Ping Observation (PC1->PC2 and PC3->PC4):
    - Collision detected in simulation mode.
    - Some packets retransmitted due to CSMA/CD.
    - Slight increase in latency observed (2-3ms).

Observations - Task 2:
  - Hub floods ALL incoming frames out of every port.
  - In Simulation Mode, every packet was visible at all PCs,
    not just the intended recipient — security concern.
  - All devices share a single collision domain.
  - When two PCs transmitted simultaneously, a collision
    occurred and CSMA/CD caused retransmission delays.
  - Performance degrades significantly as more devices
    are added or simultaneous traffic increases.
  - Hub is a Layer 1 device — no intelligence, no MAC table.

--------------------------------------------------------
TASK 3: RING-LIKE TOPOLOGY (3 Switches in Loop)
--------------------------------------------------------
IP Addressing:
  Switch A connected PCs:
    PC1 - 192.168.10.1 / 255.255.255.0
    PC2 - 192.168.10.2 / 255.255.255.0
  Switch B connected PCs:
    PC3 - 192.168.10.3 / 255.255.255.0
    PC4 - 192.168.10.4 / 255.255.255.0
  Switch C connected PCs:
    PC5 - 192.168.10.5 / 255.255.255.0
    PC6 - 192.168.10.6 / 255.255.255.0

Switch Connections (Loop):
  Switch A <-> Switch B (Fa0/1 <-> Fa0/1)
  Switch B <-> Switch C (Fa0/2 <-> Fa0/1)
  Switch C <-> Switch A (Fa0/2 <-> Fa0/2)

STP Status:
  - Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) active by default on all switches.
  - One redundant port placed in BLOCKING state to prevent loops.
  - After STP convergence (~30 seconds), network stabilized.

Ping Results (after STP convergence):
  PC1 -> PC3 (across Switch A to Switch B):
    Reply from 192.168.10.3: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128 [x4]
    Ping statistics: Packets Sent=4, Received=4, Lost=0 (0% loss)

  PC1 -> PC5 (across Switch A to Switch C):
    Reply from 192.168.10.5: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128 [x4]
    Ping statistics: Packets Sent=4, Received=4, Lost=0 (0% loss)

  PC3 -> PC6 (across Switch B to Switch C):
    Reply from 192.168.10.6: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128 [x4]
    Ping statistics: Packets Sent=4, Received=4, Lost=0 (0% loss)

Observations - Task 3:
  - STP blocked one of the redundant links to prevent
    broadcast storms and Layer 2 loops.
  - Communication was fully successful across all switches.
  - The blocked port provides a standby path for failover.
  - Network takes ~30 seconds to converge after startup.

--------------------------------------------------------
TASK 4: FAILURE TEST (Link Disconnection in Ring)
--------------------------------------------------------
Action Taken:
  - Disconnected the cable between Switch A and Switch B.
  - This was the ACTIVE path (non-blocked link).

Before Disconnection:
  PC1 -> PC3: SUCCESS (via Switch A -> Switch B directly)

After Disconnection:
  - STP detected topology change.
  - Previously BLOCKED port (Switch C <-> Switch A or B) 
    transitioned from BLOCKING -> LISTENING -> LEARNING -> FORWARDING.
  - STP reconvergence time: approximately 30-50 seconds.

  PC1 -> PC3 (immediately after disconnection):
    Request timed out.
    Request timed out.
    Request timed out.
    (Waiting for STP reconvergence...)

  PC1 -> PC3 (after STP reconvergence):
    Reply from 192.168.10.3: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
    Reply from 192.168.10.3: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
    Ping statistics: Packets Sent=4, Received=2, Lost=2 (50% loss during transition)

  PC1 -> PC5: SUCCESS (unaffected path)
  PC3 -> PC6: SUCCESS (unaffected path)

Observations - Task 4:
  - The ring topology demonstrated FAULT TOLERANCE.
  - After link failure, traffic was automatically rerouted
    through the alternate path (previously blocked by STP).
  - There was a temporary disruption (~30-50 sec) during
    STP reconvergence — this is a known limitation of classic STP.
  - Modern networks use Rapid STP (RSTP) to reduce failover
    time to under 1 second.
  - Star topology (Task 1) would have completely lost
    connectivity if the switch failed — no redundancy.
  - Ring/mesh topology provides better fault tolerance
    at the cost of slightly more complex configuration.

========================================================
OVERALL COMPARISON SUMMARY
========================================================

Topology    | Fault Tolerance | Performance  | Complexity | Cost
------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|------
Star(Switch)| Low (1 point)   | High         | Low        | Medium
Bus (Hub)   | Very Low        | Low (shared) | Very Low   | Low
Ring (Loop) | High (reroutes) | High         | Medium     | Higher

Key Takeaways:
1. Switch-based star is best for most small LAN environments.
2. Hub-based bus is outdated — collisions degrade performance.
3. Ring with STP provides redundancy but adds reconvergence delay.
4. For critical networks, redundant links + RSTP is recommended.
